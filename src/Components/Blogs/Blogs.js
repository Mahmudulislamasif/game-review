             <p>Block, inline and inline-block those are main properties in html/css.Block Element uses entire rows in a webpage portion whreas inline elements uses small portion of row. In other words, Block elements starts on a new line but inline elements not started in new line. Some basic Examples are:
             Block elements: paragraph, heading tags etc. Inline Element: span,small, bold etc. When inline elements behave as block elements then its called inline-block element.
